   		<h5>Feeling myself tied
   		to some deep wonder, 
		I tie several strings, 
		fasten the obi tightly and look in the full-length mirror.

		Feeling myself tied 
		with some bewildering bond,
		I fold many times over the psychological folds of womanhood
		which is linked to motherhood. 

		I wrap my cold and burning body
		with infinite tenderness and warmth, 
		while the man-woman relationship and four-season cycle 
		have passed over the unchanging woman’s pleasure –

		and I found myself on that day in the fragrance of spring 
		when he embraced me in my long-sleeved kimono 
		showing yellow daffodils along a running stream.
		He gently praised my twenty-year-old petals.
